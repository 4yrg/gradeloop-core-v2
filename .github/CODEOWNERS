# CODEOWNERS for gradeloop-core-v2
#
# Purpose:
# - Automatically request reviewers for changes to specific parts of the repository.
# - Help enforce review responsibilities and speed up PR triage.
#
# Ownership entries:
# - Each non-comment line maps a path pattern to one or more GitHub usernames or team handles.
# - Team handles should be in the form @org/team-name (example: @gradeloop/backend-team).
# - Usernames are in the form @username.
#
# Notes:
# - Patterns are matched from top to bottom; most-specific patterns should appear first.
# - See GitHub docs for advanced pattern details: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Example owners — update these to match your org/team names and individual reviewers:

# Add specific sensitive files to require senior review
# e.g., changes to environment/config templates or secrets handling
.env.example    @gradeloop/platform-admins @gradeloop/security-team
config/*.yml    @gradeloop/platform-admins

# Hotfix / emergency PRs: assign tech lead(s) automatically for quick review
# Use a path or label-based workflow in combination with CODEOWNERS if you want tech leads auto-requested.
hotfix/**       @gradeloop/tech-leads

# Per-file example: request frontend lead for package lock changes
package-lock.json @gradeloop/frontend-team

# If you prefer individuals, list them explicitly (replace with real usernames):
# Example:
# services/api/ @alice @bob

# Keep this file up-to-date as team membership changes.
# To change ownership behavior (e.g., require CODEOWNERS approvals), update branch protection rules in GitHub.
